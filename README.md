# Introduction 
This project aims to be a replacement for Excel spreadsheets for tracking swimmer performance.  Initially this will just be for swim meets, but may evolve to include training sessions too.

# Build and Test
With this configuration, the service client we'll need to build can reference this project and not re-implement these classes.
