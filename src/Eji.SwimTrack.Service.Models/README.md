# Eji.SwimTrack.Service.Models Project
This project serves as location for common objects accepted or returned by Eji.SwimTrack.Service.  Specifically, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).  

I don't know how common it is to pull these DTOs out into their own library, but for now it makes the most sense.
